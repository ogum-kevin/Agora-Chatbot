# Agora-Chatbot
The students chatbot!!
********Name********
In ancient Greece, the Agora was a central public space in the city where people gathered for a variety of activities. The word "agora" literally means "gathering place" or "assembly" in Greek.The Agora was typically located in the center of the city and served as a hub for commercial, political, and cultural activity. It was a place where people could buy and sell goods, participate in political debates and discussions, and engage in religious rituals and ceremonies.

One of the most famous Agoras in ancient Greece was the one located in Athens. The Athenian Agora was a large, open space surrounded by public buildings, temples, and shops. It was the site of many important events in Athenian history, including the assembly of citizens (known as the Ecclesia), trials, and festivals.

The Agora was also a place where philosophers and intellectuals would gather to discuss and debate ideas. Famous philosophers such as Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle are known to have frequented the Athenian Agora.
